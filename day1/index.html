<h1>Backend Technologies</h1>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>Python is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages which is widely used in the software industry. People use Python for Competitive Programming, Web Development, and creating software. Due to its easiest syntax, it is recommended for beginners who are new to the software engineering field. Its demand is growing at a very rapid pace due to its vast use cases in Modern Technological fields like Data Science, Machine learning, and Automation Tasks. For many years now, it has been ranked among the top Programming languages.</p>
<h2>Node Js</h2>
<p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.</p>
<h2>PHP</h2>
<p>PHP is a server-side scripting language created primarily for web development but it is also used as a general-purpose programming language. Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, which are executed on the user’s browser, PHP scripts run on the server. The results are then sent to the client’s web browser as plain HTML.</p>
<h1>Databases</h1>
<h2>MySql</h2>
<p>MySQL is a popular open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database operations. While MySQL is a specific database system accessible for free and supports various programming languages.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>

Anyone with the right skills is free to use, modify, and distribute PostgreSQL in any form. As it is highly stable, very low effort is required to maintain this DBMS.</p>
<h2>MongoDB</h2>
<p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
